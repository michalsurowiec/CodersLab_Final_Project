# Online_Shop
It was created as a final project for my Java Web developer course in CodersLab.
My idea for this project is to add some logistics tools for admins in this project to connect my two proficient fields: logistics and programming.

## Idea
Basically it is a internet shop with functionalities for users and admins. 
My main focus is in creating tools for admins, allowing them to control processes in shop and optimise costs of ordering supply and realising delivery.
Planned logistics modules for this project:
*forecasting demand, 
*order realisation management,
*warehouse supply management.

## Technologies
In this project I used Hibernate and Spring (Boot, Data, Security) framework.
